The application consists of pages such as Main Page, Home Page, Detail Page, Checkout Page, Cart Page and All Courses Page, which are presented as follows:

### Future development 
Due to limited time, the actual database was not hooked up to the application itself. This is undoubtedly something that could be worked on first. This solution would allow the storage of products data and informations about the users.
Another development possibility would be the introduction of a payment gateway handling the purchase of courses by the application user.
It would also be necessary to take care of a proper data security, as well as including authentication, which would be possible with the use of tokens and libraries such as e.g. JWT.
